	\subsubsection*{Tangent Lines \& Secant Lines}
		Recall that the slope of the line between two points on the curve \(f(x)\) is given in a few ways:
			\vspace{1.5in}

		\begin{defn}[Tangent/Secant Lines]
			The \textbf{tangent line} to a curve \(f(x)\) is a line which intersects the curve at \blank{1.5}\\[15pt]  \blank{2.5}.  A \textbf{secant line} intersects a curve \blank{1.7}\\[15pt] \blank{2.5}.
				
		\end{defn}
		Here is a brief illustration of a tangent line and a secant line.
			\newpage
			
		\begin{ex}
			The points \((2,4)\) and \((4,16)\) lie on the graph of \(f(x)\).  
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item Find the slope of the secant line between these two points.
					\vs{1}
				\item Find the formula for the secant line between these points.
					\vs{1}
					
				\item Assume \(f(x) = x^2\).  Give a quick sketch of \(f(x)\), along with the points given (you don't have to be super precise).  How ``close'' are we to having a tangent line?  Is there a way to get ``closer'' to having a tangent line?
					\vs{2}
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{ex}
			\newpage
						
		\begin{ex}
			The function \(f(x) = x^2\) is graphed below.\\
			\begin{tikzpicture}
				\begin{axis}[
					grid = both,
					grid style={line width=.1pt, draw=gray!10},
					major grid style={line width=.2pt,draw=gray!50},
					width = \textwidth,
					height = .6\textwidth,
					every tick label/.append style={font=\small},
					axis x line = middle,
					axis y line = left,
		    			every axis y label/.style={at={(ticklabel cs:1.15)}},
						y label style={at={(axis description cs:0,1.1)},anchor=north},
					ytick = {0.2, 0.4,...,4},
		    			ylabel = {$f(x)$},
		    			ymin = 0, ymax = 4.2,
	    				every axis x label/.style= {at ={(ticklabel cs:1)}},
	    				xtick = {0.1, 0.2,...,2},
		    				x label style={at={(axis description cs:1.05,0)},anchor=east},
	    				xlabel = {$x$},
	    				xmin = 0, xmax = 2.1			
				]
					\addplot[thick, domain = 0:2] {x^2};
				\end{axis}
			\end{tikzpicture}\\[10pt]
			Approximate the slope of the tangent line to \(f\) at \(x = 1\) by finding the slope of the secant line through \((1,1)\) and the following points.  Sketch a few secant lines on the graph above as well.
			\begin{center}
			\begin{multicols*}{2}
				\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
					\setlength\itemsep{1.25in}
					\item \((0.7, 0.49)\)
						
					\item \((0.8, 0.64)\)
						 							
					\item \((0.9, 0.81)\)
						\columnbreak
											
					\item \((1.3, 1.69)\)
						 							
					\item\((1.2, 1.44)\)
						 							
					\item \((1.1, 1.21)\)

				\end{enumerate}
					\raggedcolumns

	\subsubsection*{Transitioning to the Derivative}
	
		\begin{defn}[Slope of the Tangent Line 1]
			The \textbf{tangent line} to a curve \(y = f(x)\) at the point \(P(a,f(a))\) is the line through the point \(P\) with slope
			
				\\ \vspace{.75in}
			
			provided that this limit exists.
		\end{defn}
		Here are some pictures to help give some intution to the definition:

			\vspace{2in}
			
		\begin{ex}
			Find the slope of the secant line through the points \((a,f(a))\) and \((a+h,f(a+h))\)
		\end{ex}
			\vs{1}
			\newpage
			
		\begin{defn}[Slope of the Tangent Line 2]
			The \textbf{tangent line} to a curve \(y = f(x)\) at the point \(P(a,f(a))\) is the line through the point \(P\) with slope
			
				\\ \vspace{.75in}
			
			provided that this limit exists, where \(h\) is considered to be a \\ \\[5pt]
			
				\blank{3.5}.
			
		\end{defn}
		Here are some more pictures for the new defintion:
			\vs{1}
			
	\subsubsection*{Tangents \& Velocities}
		
		Suppose we want to find the average velocity of an object.  We can use the same approach as we did above to find this.  The average velocity of an object is given by
			\[v_{avg} = \dfrac{\text{change in position}}{\text{change in time}}\]
			
		\begin{ex}
			Rewrite the expression for average velocity in a way similar to how we wrote the expressions for secant lines
		\end{ex}
			\vs{1}
			\newpage
		
		\begin{rmk}[Instantaneous Velocity]
			The \emph{instantaneous velocity} of an object, given its position function \(f(x)\), is
			
				\\ \( \)\vspace{.55in} 
		\end{rmk}	
		
		\begin{ex}
			Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of a building which is 980 m above the ground.
			\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
				\item What is the velocity of the ball after 10 seconds?  Use that the equation of motion is \(s(t) = 4.9t^2\).
					\vs{1}
				\item How fast is the ball traveling when it hits the ground?
					\vs{1}
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{ex}
			\newpage
			
	\subsection*{Pre Class Practice}
		\begin{ex}
			We have two definitions of the slope of a tangent line at an input, \(x = a\).  Rewrite them here.
		\end{ex}
			\vs{1}
			
		\begin{ex}
			Let \(f(x) = x^2 + 1\) and \(a = 3\). Using either definition that you wrote above, show that the slope of the tangent line to \(f(x)\) at \(x=3\) is 6.
		\end{ex}
			\vs{1.5}
		
		\begin{ex}
			A function \(f(x)\) is graphed, along with several tangent lines.  Identify the slope of the tangent line at the points \(x = -3\) and \(x = 2\)

			\begin{itemize}
			\setlength\itemsep{15pt}
